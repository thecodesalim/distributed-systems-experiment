Developed for the server selection simulation for DISMOB COURSEWORK

# Definitions 

Latency is the round trip from the client to the server and back.

Distance is how far the server is from the client geographically.

Workload is the amount of computational power the game needs or the server has available.

# Measurement

Latency Measured in ms

Distance in m

Workload in %
